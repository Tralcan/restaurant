## Core Features:

- Cuisine Selection: Select a country or cuisine type from a dropdown list (e.g., 'Mexican', 'Indian', 'Japanese').
- Sub-Cuisine Discovery: Use a generative AI tool to dynamically fetch and display sub-cuisines related to the selected cuisine type. Example: If the user chooses Italian food, the tool will look for related subcategories (i.e. 'pizza', 'pasta', 'risotto') to populate the list. Present results to the user, allow them to select one sub-cuisine from that dynamically generated list. 
- Restaurant Locator & Visuals: Fetch restaurant listings and image results that match the selected cuisine and sub-cuisine using a search engine API. Results must also be filtered for photos containing pictures with good ambience, preferably including people, in a dining context, and in an evening or night-time setting.
- Results Display: Display a grid of restaurant listings.  Each listing should prominently show the night-time themed image as the main background element.
